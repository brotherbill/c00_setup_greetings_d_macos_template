## Project Creation and Cleanup Scripts (macOS/Linux)

This template provides scripts for creating new D projects and cleaning up build artifacts. These scripts are now located in the project root.

### 1. Make the setup script executable

```bash
chmod +x setup_new_d_project_global.sh
```

### 2. Run the setup script

```bash
./setup_new_d_project_global.sh

source ~/.zprofile
```

This will copy the project creation script to your user scripts directory and add it to your PATH.

### 3. Create a new project

You can now create a new project from anywhere:

```bash
new_d_project <project_name> "<description>"
```

Example:

```bash
cd ~/dev/d
new_d_project my_new_project "My new D project for macOS"
```

### 4. Clean up build artifacts

To remove build folders and template executables, run:

```bash
./clean.sh
```

# greetings_d

Minimal D project with working macOS Apple Silicon build and F5 debug setup in VS Code.


## Express Route

These are the shortest known-good steps to go from a mostly reset Mac mini to a working D setup for this repo.

**Note:**
You can also follow these steps on a mature developer's machine that already has VS Code, XCode, or other tools installed. In that case, you may safely skip or skim steps for software you already have. There is no harm in re-running these steps; at worst, you may be prompted to confirm or update existing installations, but nothing will be broken or lost.

## 1. Software Update

Update to latest version of Mac OS.

## 2. Install XCode

Use Apple Store to install XCode.
Open XCode, then close it.


## 3. Install VS Code

1. Go to: https://code.visualstudio.com

2. Download the installer for macOS (Apple Silicon if available).

3. Open the downloaded file and drag Visual Studio Code to the Applications folder.

4. Launch VS Code from Applications.

5. (Optional) Add VS Code to your PATH for command-line launching:

	Open VS Code, press `Cmd+Shift+P`, type `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` and run it.

6. Open VS Code once so macOS finishes its first-run setup.

7. Create `~/dev/d` and clone this repository:

	```bash
	mkdir -p ~/dev/d
	cd ~/dev/d
	git clone https://github.com/brotherbill/c00_setup_greetings_d_macos.git
	cd c00_setup_greetings_d_macos
	```

	(*Trust the authors if prompted*)

## 4. Download LDC Instead of DMD

DMD has no native arm64 macOS build. The x86_64 DMD binary (v2.112.0) was tried under Rosetta, but it
hangs at startup in `rt.sections_darwin.getTLSRange` — the D runtime's Thread Local Storage detection
code is incompatible with Rosetta's TLS emulation on Apple Silicon. This is a known, unfixed limitation;
the official dlang.org install script explicitly states that DMD does not support macOS aarch64/arm64.
LDC is the correct compiler for Apple Silicon Macs.

Visit  https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases

Download the current macOS ARM64 archive.

Example:

```text
ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64.tar.xz
```

Expand it in Finder.

If macOS blocks `ldc2` or `dub` the first time you run them:

1. Click `Done`.
2. Open `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security`.
3. Click `Open Anyway` for the blocked binary.

## 5. Move the Toolchain to a Stable Folder

Do not keep the compiler in Downloads.

Run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tools

mv ~/Downloads/ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64 ~/tools/
```

Final tool location:

```bash
~/tools/ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64
```

## 6. Add LDC and DUB to PATH

Run these in Terminal, one command at a time.

1. Set home as your working directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

2. Create `~/.zprofile` with the PATH setup:

```bash
cat > ~/.zprofile <<'EOF'
if [ -x /opt/homebrew/bin/brew ]; then
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi

if [ -d "$HOME/tools/ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64/bin" ]; then
    export PATH="$HOME/tools/ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64/bin:$PATH"
fi
EOF
```

3. Confirm the file contents:

```bash
sed -n '1,200p' ~/.zprofile
```

4. Open a new terminal, or run:

```bash
source ~/.zprofile
```

## 7. Verify the Toolchain

Run these in Terminal, one command at a time.

If any command prints `zsh: killed`, do this before retrying that same command:

1. Click `Done` on the macOS dialog.
2. Open `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security`.
3. Click `Open Anyway` for the blocked binary (`dub` or `ldc2`).
4. Authenticate when prompted.
5. Re-run only the command that was blocked.

```bash
dub --version | head -n 1
```

```bash
ldc2 --version | head -n 1
```

```bash
which dub
```

```bash
which ldc2
```

Expected result:

- `dub --version` prints DUB version information
- `ldc2 --version` prints compiler version information
- `which dub` prints a path under `/Users/<your-user>/tools/ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64/bin/dub`
- `which ldc2` prints a path under `/Users/<your-user>/tools/ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64/bin/ldc2`
- You may need to approve `dub` and `ldc2` separately in `Privacy & Security`.

## 8. Open This Repo in VS Code

Open the folder for this repo in VS Code.

Reference paths for this setup:

- Parent folder: `/Users/bb/dev/d`
- Repo folder: `/Users/bb/dev/d/c00_setup_greetings_d_macos`

Optional terminal check (one command at a time):

```bash
cd /Users/bb/dev/d/c00_setup_greetings_d_macos
```

```bash
pwd
```

```bash
cd ..
```

```bash
pwd
```

## 9. Set VS Code Theme (Course Standard)

Course standard:

- Use `Default High Contrast` (dark, high contrast).

In VS Code:

1. Open `Code` -> `Settings` -> `Theme` -> `Color Theme`
2. Choose `Default High Contrast`

Light theme options for students who prefer light mode:

- `Default Light Modern`
- `Default High Contrast Light`

Students may use any color theme that is comfortable and readable for them.

## 10. Install VS Code Extensions

Open the Extensions view:

- Click the Extensions icon in the left Activity Bar (looks like four squares), or
- Press `Cmd+Shift+X`

Install these extensions one at a time:

1. `code-d` by `WebFreak`
2. `CodeLLDB` by `Vadim Chugunov`

For each extension:

1. Type the name in the Extensions search box.
2. Click the extension in the search results to open it in the center pane.
3. Click the `Install` button in the center pane — do not use the Install button in the left search results list, as it is easy to accidentally install the wrong extension.

If VS Code asks, allow the publisher and continue installation.

## 11. Build the Project

This repo already includes the needed VS Code files:

- `.vscode/tasks.json`
- `.vscode/launch.json`

Run these in Terminal, one command at a time.

1. Navigate to the repo folder:

```bash
cd ~/dev/d/c00_setup_greetings_d_macos
```

(`~` is shorthand for your home folder — for example, `/Users/bb` on the instructor's setup.)

2. Confirm you are in the right folder:

```bash
pwd
```

Expected result: `/Users/<your-username>/dev/d/c00_setup_greetings_d_macos`

3. Build the project:

```bash
dub build --build=debug --compiler=ldc2
```

## 12. Debug with F5

Open `source/app.d`, set a breakpoint, then press `F5`.

If VS Code asks you to choose a debug configuration, select:

```text
Debug greetings_d
```

On the first debug run on macOS, you may be prompted for your sudo password. This allows the debugger to attach to the process. Enter the password and continue.

Expected result:

- the build runs first
- the debugger stops at the breakpoint
- pressing `F10` advances execution
- program output appears in the VS Code Terminal pane

For this repo, the output is:

```text
Greetings from D!
```

## Current Workspace Configuration

Build task:

```json
{
	"label": "dub: build debug",
	"type": "shell",
	"command": "dub",
	"args": ["build", "--build=debug", "--compiler=ldc2"]
}
```

Launch config:

```json
{
	"name": "Debug greetings_d",
	"type": "lldb",
	"request": "launch",
	"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
	"program": "${workspaceFolder}/greetings_d",
	"preLaunchTask": "dub: build debug",
	"console": "integratedTerminal"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- If `ldc2` or `dub` is blocked by macOS, use `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security` -> `Open Anyway`.
- If `ldc2` or `dub` is `command not found`, open a new terminal or run `source ~/.zprofile`.
- If the build fails because the toolchain moved, restore it to `~/tools/ldc2-1.42.0-osx-arm64` or update `~/.zprofile`.
- If debug runs but no output appears in the terminal pane, confirm `.vscode/launch.json` uses `"console": "integratedTerminal"`.
- If you try the official DMD macOS package on Apple Silicon, it may crash with a segmentation fault. LDC is the working path documented here.

## Quick Sanity Check (macOS)

After setup, run this from the repo root:

```bash
./sanity_check_macos.sh
```

It verifies:

- `dub` and `ldc2` are in `PATH`
- debug build works with `ldc2`
- `.vscode/tasks.json` uses `dub: build debug` with `ldc2`
- `.vscode/launch.json` uses `lldb` with `preLaunchTask` set to `dub: build debug`
