# Installing serve-d (D Language Server) on macOS Apple Silicon

serve-d is the D language server used by the VS Code `code-d` extension for autocomplete,
go-to-definition, linting, and other IDE features. The stable release only has an x86_64
macOS binary. For Apple Silicon (arm64), use the nightly pre-built binary.

## Prerequisites

- macOS Apple Silicon (arm64)
- VS Code with the `code-d` extension installed
- `~/tools` directory exists (used for developer tools such as ldc2)

## Steps

### 1. Create a directory for serve-d

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tools/serve-d
```

### 2. Download the latest nightly ARM64 binary

This is one line of code:

```bash
curl -L -o ~/tools/serve-d/serve-d.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/Pure-D/serve-d/releases/download/nightly/serve-d_osx-nightly-arm64-20251231-3c1601.tar.gz
```

> **Note:** Check https://github.com/Pure-D/serve-d/releases/tag/nightly for a newer
> `serve-d_osx-nightly-arm64-*.tar.gz` asset if you want the latest build.

### 3. Extract the archive

```bash
tar -xzf ~/tools/serve-d/serve-d.tar.gz -C ~/tools/serve-d/
```

### 4. Verify the extracted binary

```bash
ls ~/tools/serve-d/
```

Expected output includes `serve-d` (the binary).

### 5. Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x ~/tools/serve-d/serve-d
```

### 6. Test the binary

```bash
~/tools/serve-d/serve-d --version
```

### 7. Configure VS Code to use it

Open VS Code User Settings JSON (`Cmd+Shift+P` → `Open User Settings (JSON)`) and add:

```json
"d.servedPath": "/Users/<your-username>/tools/serve-d/serve-d"
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your macOS username (e.g. `bb`).

### 8. Reload VS Code

Close and reopen VS Code (or `Cmd+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`).

The `serve-d not installed` notification should no longer appear, and D language
features (autocomplete, hover, go-to-definition) will be active.

## Updating serve-d

To update, download a newer nightly ARM64 asset and overwrite the existing binary:

```bash
curl -L -o ~/tools/serve-d/serve-d.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/Pure-D/serve-d/releases/download/nightly/<new-filename>.tar.gz
  
tar -xzf ~/tools/serve-d/serve-d.tar.gz -C ~/tools/serve-d/

chmod +x ~/tools/serve-d/serve-d
```

Then reload VS Code.

## Notes

- The nightly binary is updated on successful CI commits; it is generally stable.
- The `d.servedPath` setting is a VS Code **User** setting (not workspace), so it applies
  to all D projects automatically.
- Do not use the `Compile serve-d` button in the VS Code notification — it requires DMD,
  which does not work on macOS Apple Silicon.
