# Creating a New D Project (Beginner)

This guide is for beginners. It explains how to create a new D project step by step, with extra commentary.

## What is a D project?
A D project is a collection of files for programming in the D language. This template helps you start quickly.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. Make the setup script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_new_d_project_global.sh
   ```
   This command gives permission to run the script.

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_new_d_project_global.sh
   
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
   The first command sets up the project creation tool. The second command updates your PATH so you can use the tool anywhere.
   
3. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   new_d_project <project_name> "<description>"
   ```
   Replace `<project_name>` with your project’s name and `<description>` with a short description. Example:
   ```bash
   new_d_project my_new_project "My first D project"
   ```

4. Organize your projects:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/dev/d
   
   cd ~/dev/d
   ```
   This creates a folder for your projects and moves you into it.

## Tips
- If you see `bb` in example paths, that is the author’s username. Use your own Ubuntu username instead.
- If you get stuck, ask for help or search online. Take your time and read each step carefully.
